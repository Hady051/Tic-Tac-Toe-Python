# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Python Console Version)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **pure Python**, playable entirely in the **console**. This is a two-player game where players take turns entering positions on the board. No external libraries or GUI frameworks required!

I also made it that **the numbers in the numpad are the same position you select in the box**.

And it continues until there's a **win** or a **draw**!
